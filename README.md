# QR_code
In this project i write a program that scans QR codes and Barcodes from an image. For this program, we need three packages, which are[OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/),[NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/),and [pyzbar](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/)
Most of the python programmers are familiar with OpenCV and Numpy libraries.OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library. 
It is a useful library for image processing. We are using this library in our project for processing each frame from a video captured by a device. 
We are using Numpy here because pyzbar works with OpenCV / numpy ndarrays. Whereas, pyzbar library is used to read barcodes and QR codes from a given image.
# For OpenCV 
### pip install opencv-python
# For pyzbar
### pip install pyzbar
# For Numpy
### pip install numpy
